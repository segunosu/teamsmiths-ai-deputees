## INSTRUCTION 1: Connect to Scorecard Database

```
Connect to the existing Supabase database that contains AI Impact Scorecard leads.

Database connection details:
- Supabase URL: https://iyqsbjawaampgcavsgcz.supabase.co
- Anon Key: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Iml5cXNiamF3YWFtcGdjYXZzZ2N6Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTA1OTI2MTgsImV4cCI6MjA2NjE2ODYxOH0.yOhYxzUyFYbxdu1neuagXqa2xXuhIAoWBYr3w0acNb0

Create a new Supabase client instance using these credentials that can be used throughout the app to query scorecard data.

This is a separate database from the main CRM database - it's specifically for scorecard leads.
